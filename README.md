BehavioralVideo
===============

This is a QT5-based video display and recording program designed to track experimental behavior.

Currently implemented:
(1) OpenGL-based video display
(2) Faux video generation
(3) Video acquisition using PointGrey camera drivers (only working in linux)
(4) Video compression and saving using the LibAV library

The code depends on features of QT5.2 and LibAV and the PointGrey dependencies. It has 
been tested in OSX (no PointGrey) and in Ubuntu 12.04.03
